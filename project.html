    <h2> Project on Gravity Power Generation</h2>
    <img src="Picture1.png" >
    
    <p>    The main concept of this project is to generate power using gravity as our main resource. As it is abundant in nature and cost efficient. Here we have made an arrangement of variable distance,variable angle and variable weight which can be called as DAW Arrangement.The flow of energy in the gravitator. Initially, starting torque is supplied through a permanent magnet DC Motor. The DC motor takes electrical energy and converts it into mechanical rotations of high torque. The DC motor output is given to the DAW arrangement
        The DAW arrangement converts the potential energy of the weights into rotational kinetic energy.  The mechanical rotations are of low speed and high torque. But the DC generator requires high rotations to generate electric power. So, the output of the DAW arrangement is given to the transmission system which converts it accordingly for the DC generator.  The DC generator converts the input mechanical energy into electrical energy
